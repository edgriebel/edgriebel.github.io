title: When I've left because of a manager

[The Biggest Lie in HR: People Quit Managers](https://blog.cultureamp.com/blog/the-biggest-lie-in-hr-people-quit-managers)

They say that people don't leave a company, they leave a manager. In my case that is partially true.

# Case 1
I left one job because my manager did things that were petty, but the job, org, and company also had systemic issues.

# Case 2
I left another team lead role because it felt like my manager held me responsible for everything because "You should have anticipated <X> problem and resolved it" including problems with external teams availability, hardware and infrastructure issues, etc.
I was also putting in too much time because I would allocate too many tasks to myself when we'd plan work in our iterations. 
I would also accept scope creep without negotiating existing committed features or timelines by taking on the development myself to shield the rest of the team. 
The decision to leave was also helped by a huge pay bump for the new position.

If I was faced with the same situation today I would:
* Not take on as many tasks for myself especially at the start of a project when doing a lot of architecture work and at the end where there can be more issues to fix
* Not fully allocate a team for each sprint but leave some room for unanticipated problems and work that can be pulled into the sprint if time is available
* Brainstorm and decide mitigation for problems outside of team's domain, including formalized work like [RACI Charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix)
* Realize that some deadlines are negotiable and are a starting point for a discussion instead of either accepting or rejecting them
* Related, instead of saying "no" to all scope creep and starting a battle that the team inevtiably would lose, try "We can add that, but we need 2 more weeks for this iteration, or we can deliver current feature X in the next iteration"

# People leaving because of _my_ management
Once as a team lead, over the span of a few years I had 2 people leave due to conflicts over responsibilities.
At that time I didn't have the skills then to find a compromise, and I wasn't mature enough to not dig in my heels and de-escalate.
