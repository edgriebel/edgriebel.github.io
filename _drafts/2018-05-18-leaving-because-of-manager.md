title: When I've left because of a manager
---

https://blog.cultureamp.com/blog/the-biggest-lie-in-hr-people-quit-managers

I left one job because my manager was petty but the job, org, and company sucked too. 

Another because my manager blamed me for everything, but I was also putting too much time in (to compensate for above and because I didn't delegate well or say "no") and got an offer with a huge bump.

As a team lead, on different teams I had 2 people leave because we had a conflict over their required duties and it escalated from there because I didn't know how/care to de-escalate and neither I nor wanted to back down.
