My current company has a big problem: they don’t see problems as problems. We have a number of things that outsiders would see as obvious problems but we (IT) don’t see or focus on:

* Developer Laptops or PCs that run 20% slower due to antivirus
* Firewalls that require NTLM-based authenticating proxies
* Failover from one datacenter to another takes more than single-digit minutes
* Development and IT staff having the same firewall, IT, and PC management as non-IT (e.g. Sales, HR, etc.)
* Releases that take hours instead of minutes requiring at least 20 people to participate
* Calls by web clients for read-only data take seconds to complete
* Years go between software upgrades for app servers
* Whitelisting required for any websites not in the Big Three TLDs (.com, .net, .org) or .edu
* Multi-tenancy implemented by requiring separate (virtual) database instances
