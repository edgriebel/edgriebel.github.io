# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#

# These are _probably_ pulled in automatically now
# gem "jekyll", "~> 3.7.3"
# gem "jekyll-remote-theme"
